<p> ---A drawing I made for Valentime's Day that I had published on my schools newsletter.I made this through krita while drawing on my wacom tablet only took me a couple of hours. I make stickers, logos, designs, and work on freelance work.--- </p>

<img src="../Images for Assignment/Illustration 1.jpg " width="400" height="400"  alt=" Cute design of cats floating around the England Clock Tower">
</div>

<div class="text2">
<p> I made this for a coloring book that I was working on. During the time I was at Tulsatech I worked on several projects including a cover,illustration pages, and sketeches of our final rough draft of designs. My coloring/sticker book was made specifically for kids so they could color and learn about recipes around the world. Each page featuring a new reciepe from each country. </p>

</div>

<div id="text3">
<p> This is a progress sheet that I was working on to make stickers usually when I make stickers my process is start with a sketch, have a folder or album of referenece pictures and paste your palette plus the photos on a layer. Then afterwards freehand the drawing in your own style and draw a thin white outline around it and VIOLA you got a wonderful design you can sell.  </p>

<img src="../Images for Assignment/Sketch 1.JPG" width="400" height="400" alt=" Artistic Doodle I made ">
</div>

<div class="text4">
<p> When I doodle I get inspiration from pinterest and when it comes to the color palettes I use I tend to stick to pastel coloring but sometimes if the drawing calls for monotone,complementary,monochromatic, or analogous color schemes I use those instead.  </p>
</div>

<div id="img5">
<img src="../Images for Assignment/Sketch 2.JPG" width="400" height="400" alt=" A digital drawing of an eye in fully  coloring  ">
</div>

<div id="text5">
<p> They say eyes are the window to the soul and in this drawing I did exactly that. Once I get the inspiration to draw something I spend hours on it like in this drawing. I start with my base which is the sketch then move onto the outline and then ontop of that is coloring for each piece. And adding the finishing touches. </p>
